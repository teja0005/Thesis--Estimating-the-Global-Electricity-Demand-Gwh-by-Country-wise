# Estimating the Global Electricity Demand (Gwh) by Country-wise

## ABSTRACT
The energy management system (EMS) is becoming increasingly 
crucial as global energy consumption rises. In EMS, energy projection is an 
important part of the initial phase in creating a management strategy.
The fastest-growing source of final energy demand is electricity. Its 
growth is expected to outstrip energy consumption during the next 25 years. 
More money is invested in the power sector than in oil and gas combined. The 
rise of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar is also transforming 
the worldwide electricity supply. As a result, electricity is at the front of cleanenergy transitions.
For an energy generating organization, particularly one that generates 
electricity, precise forecasting of consumption, as well as the ability to analyze 
and predict demand, is critical. It serves as the foundation for power system 
planning and operating choices.
In this project, we will create a technique for forecasting electricity 
demand. In this study, we primarily do exploratory data analysis before 
employing various forecasting models to forecast monthly consumption.
The information used ranges from 2016 to 2020. The root mean 
squared error is used to evaluate models (RMSE)

## Project Goal
The purpose of this study is to see if a general, straightforward strategy based 
on Machine Learning models can outperform a difficult forecasting challenge. 
We also look into machine learning and construct data-driven models to 
anticipate monthly energy consumption.
Transmission Service Operators (TSOs) provide energy demand predictions 
once a month to ensure that energy demand is met for the following month. 
Every month, this is done all around the world to anticipate the expected 
maximum energy consumption. These projections assist the energy industry 
in maintaining grid balance and planning supply for month-ahead bidding 
processes.
